# Song-Popularity-Prediction

## Introduction:
This project focuses on predicting the popularity of songs using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various audio features, sentiment analysis of lyrics, and metadata, the project aims to forecast whether a song will become a hit.

## Features:
* Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict song popularity.
* Analyzes audio features, sentiment analysis of lyrics, and metadata.
* Provides insights for decision-making in the music industry.

## Methodology:
* Preprocesses the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and normalization.
* Implements machine learning models including KNN, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
* Evaluates model performance through training, validation, and testing.

## Results:
* Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of approximately 92.03%.
* Decision Tree Classifier closely followed with around 84.63% accuracy.
*KNN and SVM models exhibited slightly lower accuracies of approximately 83.90% and 75.93%, respectively.
